<p dir="auto">During our "Data Engineering" course, we had the chance to choose a project for ourselves, as far as it had something to do
with "data". Me and my friend chose to work on aeronautical data, our goal was to automate a
webscraping algorythm to keep scraping, and then to exploit the data retrieved in different ways.<br><br>
First, we calculated how late every plane departed and tried to correlate the weather with that
delay. We had also retrieved the weather
from the same website.
We used this data to make different statistics such as the average plane delay for companies, the
most popular companies, etc.
Then, by using a certain plane's departure and arrival airport, and the time of takeoff, we
calculated its approximated position and decided to
show all planes of an airport on a map.<br><br>
We also did some machine learning to try to predict how late a plane was going to be depending on
certain factors, but it did not work
very well since the weather was not as correlated to the delay as we had predicted.<br><br></p>
