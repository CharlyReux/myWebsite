        <h1>My hobbies</h1>
        <p>
          I am passionated by many things other than computers. First of all I love sports, for example I practice
          climbing 3 times a week or gymnastics that I practised for 6 years when I was younger. Other than sport I
          really enjoy philosophy or astrophysics, even tho I can never find enough time to learn as much as I would
          like.<br> There is a last hobby that I haven't mentionned, I do approximatly 45 minutes per day of mandarin, I
          am hoping to be able to use this language in a real scenario as I am planning to travel if I have the
          opportunity.
